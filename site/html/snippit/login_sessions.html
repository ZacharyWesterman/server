Each time you log in, a <i>session token</i> is generated.
Afterwards, for every action you perform, the server checks this token to make sure you are who you say you are.
This token automatically expires after a while, which is why you don't stay logged in forever.

Likewise, when you revoke this token, any device using it will no longer have access to any content; any requests for
data are rejected outright.
Instead, the next action they make will immediately log them out.

Basically, the "revoke" button is just a "log out of every device" button.
