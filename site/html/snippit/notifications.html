Enabling notifications allows the <span class="error">Weather&nbsp;Alerts&nbsp;API</span> to ping you when extreme temperatures are in the forecast in your home area.
If notifications are not enabled, you will not get any weather alerts, regardless of whether your weather profile is enabled or not.

More features will likely be added in the future, but for now this is the only use.
