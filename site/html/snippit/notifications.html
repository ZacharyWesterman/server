Enabling notifications allows the server to send you a push notification whenever something important happens.
This can include weather alerts, requests to borrow a book you own, and so on.
<br><br>
These notifications are on a <i>per-device</i> basis, so you must explicitly enable notifications on every device that you want to receive them on.
If notifications are not enabled, you will not get any alerts on that device, and you will have to manually check the site to view any missed notifications.
<br><br>
Notifications of course can be disabled at any time. Just click the checkbox to toggle them on or off on this device.
