A user group indicates which groups of users may interact with and view each other's data.
<br><br>
All users in the same group can see each other's "public" data.
However, users that do not share a group will never see each other's data; Those users will never be able to interact.
<br><br>
Groups are of course entirely optional, and if left blank, the user will be treated as if they are in <i>every possible group</i>.
<br><br>
<sub>(Currently, a maximum of one group is allowed per user)</sub>
