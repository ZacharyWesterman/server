A user group indicates which groups of users may interact with and view each other's data.
<br><br>
All users in the same group can see each other's "public" data.
However, users that do not share a group will never see each other's data. Those users will never be able to interact,
neither will they be able to discern that they are in a group at all; <u>group info is solely an admin tool</u>.
<br><br>
Groups are of course entirely optional, and if left blank, the user will be treated as if they are in <i>every possible
	group</i>.
<br><br>
To indicate multiple groups, place a comma between the group names.
