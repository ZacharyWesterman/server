This page serves as a way to automatically fetch and collate documents from other websites as updates become available.
This is an alternative to having to check periodically for updates whenever you remember to, instead the server will
handle it for you.
<br><br>
Some good uses for a data feed include:
<ul>
	<li>Webcomics that are in-progress.</li>
	<li>Periodicals or other articles that come out irregularly.</li>
	<li>Forum posts or other thread-like entities.</li>
</ul>

Note that feeds will not update instantly, and may take a day or more to fetch the latest documents. If the data is
updated more than once a day, it would be better to just manually check it daily.
